# Loop REST API Reference

Welcome to the REST API reference documentation for Lightning Loop.

Lightning Loop is a non-custodial service offered by Lightning Labs to bridge
on-chain and off-chain Bitcoin using submarine swaps. This repository is home to
the Loop client and depends on the Lightning Network daemon lnd. All of lndâ€™s
supported chain backends are fully supported when using the Loop client:
Neutrino, Bitcoin Core, and btcd.

The service can be used in various situations:

* Acquiring inbound channel liquidity from arbitrary nodes on the Lightning
  network
* Depositing funds to a Bitcoin on-chain address without closing active
  channels
* Paying to on-chain fallback addresses in the case of insufficient route
  liquidity
* Refilling depleted channels with funds from cold-wallets or exchange
  withdrawals
* Servicing off-chain Lightning withdrawals using on-chain payments, with no
  funds in channels required
* As a failsafe payment method that can be used when channel liquidity along a
  route is insufficient

This site features the API documentation for shell script (CLI), Python and
JavaScript clients in order to communicate with a local `loopd` instance through
gRPC.

The examples to the right assume that the there is a local `loopd` instance
running and listening for REST connections on port {{ restport }}. `LOOP_DIR`
will be used as a placeholder to denote the base directory of the `loopd`
instance. By default, this is `~/.loop` on Linux and
`~/Library/Application Support/Loop` on macOS.

At the time of writing this documentation, two things are needed in order to
make an HTTP request to an `loopd` instance: a TLS/SSL connection and a
macaroon used for RPC authentication. The examples to the right will show how
these can be used in order to make a successful, secure, and authenticated HTTP
request.

The original `*.swagger.js` files from which the gRPC documentation was generated
can be found here:

{% for file in files %}- [`{{ file }}`]({{ repoUrl }}/blob/{{ commit }}/{{ rpcdir }}/{{file}})
{% endfor %}

**NOTE**: The `byte` field type must be set as the base64 encoded string
representation of a raw byte array. Also, any time this must be used in a URL path
(ie. `/v1/abc/xyz/{payment_hash}`) the base64 string must be encoded using a
[URL and Filename Safe Alphabet](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5). This means you must replace `+` with `-`,
`/` with `_`, and keep the trailing `=` as is. Url encoding (ie. `%2F`) will not work.


This is the reference for the **REST API**. Alternatively, there is also a [gRPC
API which is documented here](#loop-grpc-api-reference).
